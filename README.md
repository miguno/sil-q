Sil-Q is a free, single-player game with a strong emphasis on exploration and
tactical combat. It has a simple but rich combat system which allows for a great
variety of choice.

You play an adventurer who must venture deep into the dungeons of Angband, the
fortress of the Dark Lord Morgoth, and attempt to steal a precious Silmaril from
his iron crown and escape alive!

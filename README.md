**Sil-Q is a free, single-player dungeon infiltration game.** It has a strong
emphasis on exploration and tactical combat. It features a simple but rich
combat and stealth system which gives players a great variety of choice.

You play an adventurer who must venture deep into the dungeons of Angband, the
fortress of the Dark Lord Morgoth, and attempt to steal a precious Silmaril from
his iron crown and escape alive!

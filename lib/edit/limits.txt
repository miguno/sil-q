#
# M:code:value
#
# 'M' is the limit marker followed by a code letter and one or more values.
#
# Limit codes:
#   M:F:value - Max number of feature/terrain types
#   M:K:value - Max number of object kinds
#   M:B:value - Max number of abilities
#   M:A:special:normal:random:self-made - Max numbers of artefacts
#               Important note: Changing these numbers will almost always break
#               savefile compatibility!
#   M:E:value - Max number of special item (ego) types
#   M:R:value - Max number of monster races
#   M:G:value - Max number of ghost templates
#   M:V:value - Max number of vaults
#   M:P:value - Max number of player races
#   M:C:value - Max number of player houses
#   M:H:value - Max number of player history lines
#   M:Q:value - Max number of quests

#   M:N:value - Size of names array (bytes)
#   M:T:value - Size of descriptions array (bytes)
#
#
# === Notes ===
#
# - These numbers are all actually the maximum + 1, (except for the artefact
#   non-total numbers).
